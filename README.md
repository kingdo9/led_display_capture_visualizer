# led_display_capture_visualizer

Test concept to create an image from a raw logic capture from an FM6373 + DP32019B LED display<br /><br />

Logic captures from KingST analyzer, exported to CSV.

Only coded to work with this specific display combination. It was ai coded to test the positional layouts, I don't pretend to be an expert coder.
Brightness toggle was also an experiment, you can see the gradients however it is not accurate by a long shot.<br /><br />
